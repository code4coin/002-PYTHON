## 🧠 Why Python After SQL?

```
SQL taught you    →  How to STORE and QUERY data
Python will teach →  How to MANIPULATE, AUTOMATE and BUILD with data
Together they     →  Make you a complete Data / Backend Engineer
```

This is not starting over. Every SQL concept you know will make Python
libraries like Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and psycopg2 feel completely natural.
